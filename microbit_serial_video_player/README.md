# Instructions
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download) on your computer.
2. Download this folder and save it to Documents --> Processing (or anywhere else that you can remember).
3. If this is your first time using the project, go to Sketch --> Import Library --> Add Library and install the `Video | GStreamer-based video library for Processing` library.
4. Connect the receiver micro:bit to the computer *BEFORE* running the code (select the play button) on the top left.
> The micro:bit should already have code that writes the line "A" to serial when the video is to be played.
5. When the micro:bit is triggered, the video should start playing.

# Modifying the code
There have been comments written next to most lines of the code that explains what it does. If you would like to change the video used, just download the video into the `data` folder and replace `video1.mp4` with the new video name.
